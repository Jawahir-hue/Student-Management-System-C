1. What is this project
This program is called
Student Management System
It is like a small school notebook inside the computer.
It can
• Save students
• Show them
• Find them
• Update them
• Delete them
• Sort them
• Save them to file
• Load them again
So your computer becomes a tiny school office.

2. What is a program
A program is just instructions for the computer.
Like
Open book
Read page
Write name
Calculate marks
C plus plus just uses special English words to give these instructions.
________________________________________
3. What is this part
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;
This means
Hey computer, I want to use
• screen input output
• text like names
• files
It is like telling the computer
Give me paper, pen and a notebook.
________________________________________
4. These two lines
#define SUBJECTS 5
#define MAX 100
This means
Each student has 5 subjects
We can store maximum 100 students
So the program knows the limits.
________________________________________
5. What is union
union Result {
    float percentage;
    float gpa;
};
Think of union like one box.
This box can store
Either percentage
Or GPA
Not both at same time.
We use it because teacher told in project to use union.
________________________________________
6. What is struct
struct Student {
    int id;
    string name;
    float marks[SUBJECTS];
    float average;
    char grade;
    Result result;
};
A struct is like a student form.
Inside one student we keep
ID
Name
5 marks
Average
Grade
Percentage
So one student is one complete record.
________________________________________
7. This is memory
Student students[MAX];
int total = 0;
This creates space for 100 students.
total means how many students are stored right now.
At start it is 0.
________________________________________
8. This function
float calculateAverage(float m[])
This adds all marks and divides by 5.
It is like
(80 + 70 + 90 + 60 + 75) / 5
So computer does math for us.
________________________________________
9. This function
char calculateGrade(float avg)
If average is
90 or more = A
80 or more = B
70 or more = C
60 or more = D
Else = F
So grade is decided.
________________________________________
10. Add student
This function asks
Enter ID
Enter name
Enter 5 marks
Then it
Calculates average
Calculates grade
Stores it inside students array
So new student is saved in memory.
________________________________________
11. Pointer
void displayStudent(Student* s)
Pointer means
Instead of copying student
We send its address
Like pointing your finger to a page instead of copying the whole book.
So it is faster.
________________________________________
12. Search
When we search by ID or name
The program goes through every student
One by one
Until it finds match
This is like looking through a list.
________________________________________
13. Update
When you update
It finds student
Asks new marks
Recalculates average and grade
So marks change.
________________________________________
14. Delete
When deleting
It removes that student
And shifts others up
Like removing one paper from middle of a file.
________________________________________
15. Sorting
Sort by average
Means highest marks first
Sort by name
Means A to Z order
So data becomes clean.
________________________________________
16. File save
ofstream file("students.txt");
This creates a real file on computer.
All student data is written inside it.
So when program closes
Data is not lost.
________________________________________
17. Load
ifstream file("students.txt");
This reads back the file.
So students come back when you run program again.
________________________________________
18. Menu
The menu is just a list of options.
You type
1
2
3
And computer does that work.
________________________________________
19. Main function
This is where program starts.
It keeps showing menu
Until you choose Exit.

20. What you learned
From this one project you learned
• variables
• arrays
• functions
• loops
• structures
• union
• pointers
• file handling
• searching
• sorting
• real software logic
This is not small.
This is big.
